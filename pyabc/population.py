class Particle:
    """
    An (accepted or rejected) particle, containing the information that will
    also be stored in the database.
    Stores all summary statistics that
    were generated during the creation of this particle, and a flag
    indicating whether this particle was accepted or not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m:
        The model index.
    parameter:
        The model specific parameter.
    weight:
        The weight of the particle. 0 <= weight <= 1.
    sum_stat:
        Model simulation.
    distance:
        Distance of simulated and measured data.
    accepted:
        True if particle was accepted, False if not.
    proposal_id:
        An identifier for the proposal the particle was generated from.
        This allows grouping particles accordingly.
    preliminary:
        Whether this particle is only preliminarily accepted. Must be False
        eventually for all particles.

    .. note::
        There are two different ways of weighting particles: First, the weights
        can be calculated as emerges from the importance sampling. Second, the
        weights of particles belonging to one model can be summed to, after
        normalization, find model probabilities. Then, the weights of all
        particles belonging to one model can be summed to one.
        Weighting is transferred to the second way in _normalize_weights() in
        order to also have access to model probabilities. This mode is also
        stored in the database. If one needs access to the first weighting
        scheme later on again, one has to perform backwards transformation,
        multiplying the weights with the model probabilities.
