Acceptor
--------

After summary statistics for samples for given parameters have
been generated, it must be checked whether these are to be
accepted or not. This happens in the Acceptor class.

The most typical and simple way is to compute the distance
between simulated and observed summary statistics, and accept
if this distance is below some epsilon threshold. However, also
more complex acceptance criteria are possible, in particular
when the distance measure and epsilon criteria develop over
time.
