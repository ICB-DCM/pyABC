    show_progress: bool
        Whether to show progress within a generation.
        Some samplers support this by e.g. showing a progress bar.

        Performs the sampling, i.e. creation of a new generation (i.e.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n:
            The number of samples to be accepted. I.e. the population size.
        simulate_one:
            A function which internally performs the whole process of
            sampling parameters, simulating data, and comparing to observed
            data to check for acceptance, as indicated via the
            particle.accepted flag.
        t:
            Generation index for which to sample.
        max_eval:
            Maximum number of evaluations to perform. Some samplers can check
            this condition directly and can thus terminate proactively.
        all_accepted:
            If it is known in advance that all sampled particles will have
            particle.accepted == True, then setting all_accepted = True can
            reduce the computational overhead for dynamic schedulers. This
            is usually in particular the case in the initial calibration
            iteration.
        ana_vars:
            Various analysis variables. Some samplers can use these e.g. for
            proactive sampling.

        Returns
        -------
        sample: :class:`pyabc.sampler.Sample`
            The generated sample, which contains the new population.
