Distance functions
==================

Distance functions measure closeness of observed and sampled data. This
module implements various commonly used distance functions for ABC, featuring
a few advanced concepts.

For custom distance functions, either pass a plain function to ABCSMC or
subclass the pyabc.Distance class.
