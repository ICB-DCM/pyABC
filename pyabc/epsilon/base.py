        Parameters
        ----------
        t:

        This is called by the ABCSMC class and gives the epsilon

        epsilon to the statistics of the sample.
        The method is called by the ABCSMC framework before the first
        use of the epsilon (at the beginning of ABCSMC.run()), after
        initialize().

        Parameters
        ----------
        sampler: Sampler
            The sampler used in ABCSMC.

        get_weighted_distances:
