"""
Acceptor
--------

After summary statistics for samples for given parameters have
been generated, it must be checked whether these are to be
accepted or not. This happens in the Acceptor class.

The most typical and simple way is to compute the distance
between simulated and observed summary statistics, and accept
if this distance is below some epsilon threshold. However, also
more complex acceptance criteria are possible, in particular
when the distance measure and epsilon criteria develop over
time.

        Compute distance between summary statistics and evaluate whether to
        accept or reject.

        This class is abstract and cannot be used on its own. The simplest
        usable class is the derived SimpleAcceptor.

        Parameters
        ----------

        t: int
            Time point for which to check.

        distance_function: pyabc.DistanceFunction
            The distance function.
            The user is free to use or ignore this function.

        eps: pyabc.Epsilon
            The acceptance thresholds.

        x: dict
            Current summary statistics to evaluate.

        x_0: dict
            The observed summary statistics.

        Returns
        -------

        (distance, accept): (float, bool)
            True: The distance function is below the epsilon threshold.
            False: The distance function is above the epsilon threshold.

        .. note::
            Currently, only one value encoding the distance is returned
            (and stored in the database),
            namely that at time t, even if also other distances affect the
            acceptance decision, e.g. distances from previous iterations. This
            is because the last distance is likely to be most informative for
            the further process.
