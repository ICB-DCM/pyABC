Contributing Documentation
==========================

Documentation is an essential part of the software development process.
We want to provide a useful piece of software. It is therefore necessary to
have a good documentation such that the user knows how to use our package.
Contributions to the documentation are as welcome as contributions to the code.


Docstrings
----------

We follow the numpy docstring standard.
Check `here <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_ for a
