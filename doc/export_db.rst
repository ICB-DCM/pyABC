Exporting pyABC's database to other file formats
------------------------------------------------

pyABC ships with a small convenience utility, which allows to export
pyABC's SQL database to other formats. Supported formats are:

* CSV
* feather
* json
* msgpack
* html
* hdf
* stata

An example call might look as follows::

   abc-export --db results.db --out exported.feather --format feather

This exports the database "results.db" generated by pyABC to "exported.feather"
which is written in in the feather format as indicated by the option
``--format feather`` (the file extension of the exported file is not parsed).

Check::

    abc-export --help

for further options to customize the export.
