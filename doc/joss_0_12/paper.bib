  abstract      = {Summary: Likelihood-free methods are often required for inference in systems biology. While approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) provides a theoretical solution, its practical application has often been challenging due to its high computational demands. To scale likelihood-free inference to computationally demanding stochastic models, we developed pyABC: a distributed and scalable ABC-Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) framework. It implements a scalable, runtime-minimizing parallelization strategy for multi-core and distributed environments scaling to thousands of cores. The framework is accessible to non-expert users and also enables advanced users to experiment with and to custom implement many options of ABC-SMC schemes, such as acceptance threshold schedules, transition kernels and distance functions without alteration of pyABC's source code. pyABC includes a web interface to visualize ongoing and finished ABC-SMC runs and exposes an API for data querying and post-processing.
Availability and Implementation: pyABC is written in Python 3 and is released under a 3-clause BSD license. The source code is hosted on https://github.com/icb-dcm/pyabc and the documentation on http://pyabc.readthedocs.io. It can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

@article{SchaelteHas2020,
	abstract = {{Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is an increasingly popular method for likelihood-free parameter inference in systems biology and other fields of research, as it allows analyzing complex stochastic models. However, the introduced approximation error is often not clear. It has been shown that ABC actually gives exact inference under the implicit assumption of a measurement noise model. Noise being common in biological systems, it is intriguing to exploit this insight. But this is difficult in practice, as ABC is in general highly computationally demanding. Thus, the question we want to answer here is how to efficiently account for measurement noise in ABC.We illustrate exemplarily how ABC yields erroneous parameter estimates when neglecting measurement noise. Then, we discuss practical ways of correctly including the measurement noise in the analysis. We present an efficient adaptive sequential importance sampling-based algorithm applicable to various model types and noise models. We test and compare it on several models, including ordinary and stochastic differential equations, Markov jump processes and stochastically interacting agents, and noise models including normal, Laplace and Poisson noise. We conclude that the proposed algorithm could improve the accuracy of parameter estimates for a broad spectrum of applications.The developed algorithms are made publicly available as part of the open-source python toolbox pyABC (https://github.com/icb-dcm/pyabc).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

Yet, there has been---so far---no broadly supported format for the specification of parameter estimation problems in systems biology. Here, we introduce PEtab, a format which facilitates the specification of parameter estimation problems using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models and a set of tab-separated value files describing the observation model and experimental data as well as parameters to be estimated. We already implemented PEtab support into eight well-established model simulation and parameter estimation toolboxes with hundreds of users in total. We provide a Python library for validation and modification of a PEtab problem and currently 20 example parameter estimation problems based on recent studies.},
