"""Performance tests and comparisons.

This is to e.g. compare how fast the various samplers are, and to assert that
various parts of the pyABC implementation are efficient compared to alternative
implementations.

Note: It would be good to maintain a proper collection of performance tests
and comparisons. At the moment, the checks here are only rudimentary.
